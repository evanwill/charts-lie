ask questions when you look at a chart:

- Unlabelled, unsourced data (is this quality data, are they clear about uncertainty, is it the correct data for the question, is there enough data for the answer)
- Using the wrong type of chart (pie charts, does the chart type support the visual argument / comparison )
    - [Data to Viz Caveats](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html)
- poor design and unnecessary embellishment (bad colors, 3d, spaghetti charts, too many variables)
    - "embellishment that does not add to meaning or clarity" (3d)
    - conventions and expectations (color for hot+cold, color progression of values, up/down)
- problems with scale (truncated axis, different axis, dual axis) - this is often to exaggerate or diminish appearance of change, e.g. stretch the x-axis to make line chart appear steeper or flatter
- omitting or cherry-picking data (remove some data to appear smooth trends, don't present all data, limited scope, binning, only presenting the most convincing chart while ignoring others, statistical bias, confirmation bias)
- correlating causation (plotting unrelated things together, issues with absolute vs relative values i.e. population density maps or dollars compared without inflation or % of population) https://xkcd.com/1138/
