Like "the numbers" or "the stats", data visualizations are very convincing!
Marketing, politicians, media, businesses, professors, and your friends all know this--we get bombarded with visual information everyday trying to persuade us. 
We interpret data visualizations to make decisions, from simple everyday choices to huge impactful decisions.

In *How Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information* (2019), Alberto Cairo says visualizations can be misleading, misunderstood, or actually lying by:

- being poorly designed
- displaying dubious data
- displaying insufficient data
- concealing or confusing uncertainty
- suggesting misleading patterns

We need to carefully evaluate and interpret visualizations to ensure we are getting the correct information and are able to avoid misleading information. 
A critical eye is necessary!

## Critical Data Visualization Literacy

{% capture lit %}The invention of the printing press created a mandate for universal textual literacy; the need to manipulate many large numbers created a need for mathematical literacy; and the ubiquity and importance of photography, film, and digital drawing tools posed a need for visual literacy. Analogously, the increasing availability of large datasets, the importance of understanding them, and the utility of data visualizations to inform data-driven decision making pose a need for universal data visualization literacy (DVL). Like other literacies, DVL aims to promote better communication and collaboration, empower users to understand their world, build individual self-efficacy, and improve decision making in businesses and governments.{% endcapture %}
